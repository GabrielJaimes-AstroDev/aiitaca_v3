A remarkable upsurge in the complexity of molecules identified in the interstellar medium (ISM) is currently occurring, 
with over 80 new species discovered in the last three years. A number of them have been emphasized by prebiotic 
experiments as vital molecular building blocks of life. Since our Solar System was formed from a molecular cloud in the ISM, 
it prompts the query as to whether the rich interstellar chemical reservoir could have played a role in the emergence of life.
